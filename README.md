# LB LIFX         
 LIFX extension for LioranBoard which allows you to control your LIFX smart lights.

This extension for LioranBoard allows you to fully control your LIFX lights. It is superior to using IFTTT as there's an extremely short delay and you can execute requests in rapid succession.       
All you need is to get your LIFX token which is a very simple process that takes less than a minute.       

**Features:**      
List all my lights (Transmitter only) - lists all your LIFX devices and their current state/manufacturer information       
Get Light - gets a state of one single light    
Toggle Power    
Activate Scene      
Set State     
State Delta     
Effects: Breathe, Flame, Morph, Move, Pulse     
Effects Off      
Clean Mode      

The extension also has a 'fast mode' where you can execute the command without initial state checks and wait for no results. You could potentially implement this with a Reenable If command to rapidly change your light effects. 

Setup instructions can be found at https://christinna9031.github.io/LBDocumentation/externalext.html#Lifx. 

*Note: I do not own LIFX lights, this extension was made with RamsReef's help who was kind enough to let me control one of his lights.*

**How to install an extension:**
1. Download the .lbe extension file from **Releases** section (please do not right click and save) 
2. Click on Install Extension in your LioranBoard Receiver
3. Select the extension file you downloaded 
4. Select your default Transmitter you are using. Make 100% sure it is the correct one. 
5. Refresh your Transmitter or close and reopen Lioranboard Receiver. 
6. Most extensions include a premade deck with buttons. If you do not see one, create a new button, add "Send to Extensions" command and select the extension you just installed. If you can only see the extension name with no input fields, it means it was not installed correctly. Repeat steps above.
